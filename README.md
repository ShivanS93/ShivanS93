# Kia ora and Welcome 👋

_Kia ora_ is a greeting in Te Reo Māori, the indigenous language of Aoetearoa, New Zealand.

### 😄 Who am I?
My name is Shivan Sivakumaran. I am Kiwi 🇳🇿 with Sri Lankan 🇱🇰 heritage.

An Optometrist by trade, I am very interested in programming and technology in general.

Strange pairing, right? Eyecare 👓 and technology 🖥️. As an Optometrist, I work with people one-to-one. However, technology is a powerful tool that allows me to help others at scale.

- [Optom Chitchat]("https://github.com/optom-chitchat"): A Django application for optometrists to post annoying things about their day
- [Green Your Impact]("https://github.com/shivans93/green-your-impact"): An application written using Django REST Framework and ReactJS to reward users for reducing carbon emissions
- [Nutrify](https://github.com/shivans93/nutrify): Working alongside [mrdbourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke) in creating an application where users can learn about nutrient data simple by taking a photo of what they are eating.
